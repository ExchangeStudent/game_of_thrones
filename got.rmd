### Introduction
![](got.jpg)

I accidentally dug up a treasure!

While browsing [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mylesoneill/game-of-thrones) datasets, I came across a dataset that summarises statistics of Game of Thrones battles. I am a huge Game of Thrones fan and I could not pass up the opportunity to do some exploratory data analysis on such a cool dataset. You can learn more about Game of Thrones [here](https://www.hbo.com/game-of-thrones).

I used R markdown to explore the data and the actual code is included [here](https://github.com/ExchangeStudent/game_of_thrones).

A list of some of the things you will learn by looking at the [code](https://github.com/ExchangeStudent/game_of_thrones):

* How to structure your R markdown report header
* Include headings in your R markdown reports
* Include lists in your R markdown reports
* Include inline code in your R markdown reports
* Include images in your R markdown reports
* Include links in your R markdown reports
* Creating tables and plots in R
* Basic data analysis in R

```{r include=FALSE}
# Loading the data into R and importing useful libraries
library("data.table")
library("ggplot2")
library("knitr")
library("readxl")
library("kableExtra")
library("dplyr")
library("janitor")
library("tidyr")
library("formattable")

# import data files and save as battles
battles <- data.table(read_excel("battles.xlsx"))

# table showing number of times each king attacked other kings
number_attack <- battles[, .(Attacks=.N), by=.(attacker_king)][order(Attacks)]

# table showing number of times each king had to defend an attack
number_defend <- battles[, .(Defends=.N), by=.(defender_king)][order(Defends)]
```

### Let's take a quick look at the data

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
kable(battles[,-25], "html") %>% kable_styling(full_width=T,latex_options = "striped") %>% scroll_box( height = "500px")
```
We can display all the rows of the data because it is a small dataset.

`note` column has not been displayed. It is mostly blank and is not relevant to this analysis.

The total number of battles fought was **`r dim(battles)[1]`**.

### How many times did each king attack?

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=10}

Attacks <- ggplot(aes(x = factor(attacker_king)), data = battles[attacker_king != ""], fill=factor(attacker_king)) +
    geom_bar(aes(fill=attacker_king), width=1, colour="black") +
    ggtitle("Number of Attacks per King") +
    xlab("Attacker Kings") + ylab("No of Battles")
print(Attacks)
```
**2** battles have been excluded due to blank `attacker_king` fields.

With **`r number_attack[.N,2]`** attacks, **`r number_attack[.N,1]`** was the most aggressive king.


### How many times did each king defend an attack?


```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=10}

Attacked <- ggplot(aes(x = factor(defender_king)), data = battles[defender_king != ""], fill=factor(defender_king)) +
    geom_bar(aes(fill=defender_king), width=1, colour="black") +
    ggtitle("No of times attacked") +
    xlab("defender Kings") + ylab("No of Battles") +
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle =45, vjust = 0.5))
print(Attacked)
```
**2** battles have been excluded due to blank `defender_king` fields.

Having been attacked **`r number_defend[.N,2]`** times, **`r number_defend[.N,1]`** had to fend off the most number of attacks.


### In which region were most battles fought?

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=10}
ggplot(aes(x = region), data = battles, fill=region) + geom_bar(aes(fill=region), width=1, colour="black")
```

Most battles were fought in **`r battles[,.(count=.N), by=region][order(count)][.N,1]`** while the least number of battes were fought **`r battles[,.(count=.N), by=region][order(count)][1,1]`**.

Take a look at a map of Westeros in the next section below.

### Battle_type and battle outcome

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}

outcome <- battles[attacker_outcome != "", .(counts=.N), by=.(battle_type,attacker_outcome)] %>% group_by(battle_type, attacker_outcome) %>% summarise(counts) %>% spread(attacker_outcome,counts, fill=0) %>% adorn_totals(where = c("col","row")) %>% mutate("% wins" = percent(win/Total, digits=0) )

kable(outcome, booktabs = T) %>% kable_styling(full_width=T,latex_options = "striped")

```

**1** battle has been excluded due to a blank `attacker_outcome` field.

The most popular type of battle was **pitched battle**.

**Ambush** was very popular and had a **100%** success rate.

### Was it better to attack or to defend?

In the table of outcomes above, it is clear that attacking was a much more effective strategy with **86%** success rate.
